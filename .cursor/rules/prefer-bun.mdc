# Bun as the Preferred Package Manager

Wherever possible, prefer to use **Bun** for package management, scripts, and development tasks instead of npm, yarn, or pnpm.

- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install`.
- Use `bun run` for running scripts and development servers.
- If a script or command is referenced in documentation or code comments, prefer the Bun equivalent.
- Only use npm, yarn, or pnpm if Bun is not supported for a specific tool or workflow.

This applies to all packages and sub-packages in the monorepo, unless otherwise specified.
