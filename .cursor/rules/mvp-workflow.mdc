# MVP Workflow Rule

## Current Phase: MVP Development

### Focus Areas
- **Implementation over perfection** - Get features working first
- **Core functionality** - Essential user flows and data management
- **Basic error handling** - Prevent crashes, detailed logging later
- **Simple UI/UX** - Functional over beautiful

### Post-MVP Rules (Future)
When MVP is declared complete, implement:
- Error handling consistency rules
- Logging pattern rules  
- Testing coverage rules
- API versioning rules
- Performance optimization rules

## Why This Approach
- **Speed to market** - Validate core concept quickly
- **Iterative improvement** - Build quality incrementally
- **Resource efficiency** - Focus on what matters most
- **User feedback** - Learn from real usage before over-engineering

## Current Priorities
1. **Authentication flow** - âœ… Complete
2. **User management** - In progress
3. **Document management** - Planned
4. **Role-based access** - Planned
5. **Basic dashboard** - In progress

## Quality Standards (Post-MVP)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging
- Unit and integration tests
- API documentation
- Performance monitoring
- Security audits
